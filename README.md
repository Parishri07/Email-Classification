# Classification-algorithm-models


This repository outlines an email classification project. Leveraging Python, the project encompasses data ingestion, comprehensive text preprocessing (including stop word removal and character elimination), and insightful data visualization through box plots and word clouds. By employing Grid Search CV and Naive Bayes, the model achieves a remarkable 97% accuracy in classifying emails as spam or ham.
